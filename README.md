# FIGHTERWING

DESCRIPTION
The FIGHTERWING is an open source project providing an .stl file for the T-Rex Arms Sidecar.
It is a magnetic bridge that gives you a magnetic attach point. Ideal for an extra glock mag. Could be modified to hold other tools, or paired with the spare mag attachment to have 2 extra mags. 

ASSEMBLY
It is directional. Put the logo next to the gun to provide appropriate ergonomic space between the pistol and the mag. 
For assembly, you will need a magnet with the dimensions 1" x .33". Attach can be a simple press fit, or, using JB Weld you can make sure it never comes out.

Run a 1/4 drill bit through the holes when finished for best fitment. 

PRINTING
This file prints with no supports. 
10-25% infill will be fine.
.2 layer height is acceptable. 
Depeding on printer type and settings it may be prefferable to print using a raft.
